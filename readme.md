### Comments

The upload server-side-api is non functioning after realising I'd already spent a few hours on the project and felt it was un-important to finish since it isn't part of the task. Technically the client side execution is working however, although untested.

Apologies for the lack of client-side tests. Could not think of any decent tests to write without using automated browser control, which I believe would be beyond the scope of this project. ~~Also just realised as I am writing this that I haven't added a type column and a filter for it. I could add that later tonight but I'm about to get on a bus right now and would rather not delay in sending the files across to you now.~~ *Done*
